                The Labs page is an experimental workspace for analyzing route difficulty and human route-finding
                behavior across your venue&apos;s graph. Pick a lab from the <strong>Lab</strong> selector; each lab
                keeps its own state, so switching between them doesn&apos;t lose your place.

                <li><strong>Most Difficult Legs (Controls):</strong> Analyzes routes between all pairs of controls and ranks them by difficulty score, using Dijkstra&apos;s shortest path algorithm.</li>
                <li><strong>Most Difficult Legs (Nodes):</strong> Analyzes routes between all pairs of graph nodes, providing a broader view of difficult segments across the entire venue.</li>

                <li><strong>Clustered Graph:</strong> Groups the entire venue&apos;s graph into same-floor regions (nodes mutually reachable via ordinary corridors, without using any stairs) and colors the map accordingly, so you can see corridor connectivity at a glance.</li>

                <li>Select the Controls or Nodes lab.</li>
                <li>Set the number of top routes to display.</li>
                <li>Click <Play className={iconClass} /><strong>Run Analysis</strong> to start. Progress is shown during computation.</li>
                <li>Click <Square className={iconClass} /><strong>Stop</strong> at any time to abort.</li>

              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
                <li>Select the Human Thinking Simulation lab.</li>
                <li>Pick a course and a leg (control-to-control) — the search runs automatically and builds the step-by-step trace.</li>
                <li>Use <SkipBack className={iconClass} /><strong>Previous</strong>, <Play className={iconClass} />/<Pause className={iconClass} /><strong>Play/Pause</strong>, and <SkipForward className={iconClass} /><strong>Next</strong> to step through the simulation, or pick a playback speed. Shortcuts: <strong>Space</strong> play/pause, <strong>&larr;</strong>/<strong>&rarr;</strong> step back/forward. Click any message in the explanation log to jump straight to that step.</li>
                <li>Each message in the log is prefixed by an icon showing what kind of step it is: a magnifying glass for the same-floor check, a footprint for a normal tracking step, an undo arrow for a backtracking step, and a checkmark once a solution is found.</li>
                <li>If the leg needs stairs, the first step always checks that a direct same-floor path isn't possible, e.g. "Same floor? No - we need to check the stairs." — this is the same same-floor check that short-circuits legs that don't need stairs at all.</li>
                <li>Each following step is narrated concretely, e.g. "From control 3 on floor 1, we can reach stairs A, B and C. Let us try up A." — tracking steps start with "From" (where the human currently stands); backtracking steps are prefixed "Backtracking: " and start with "To" (where the plan is trying to reach), naming the floor the candidate stair leads from, e.g. "Backtracking: To control 4 on floor 3, we can come from stairs A, B and C. Let us try up A from floor 2."</li>
                <li>The map overlay shows only the current step: the tracking/backtracking routes committed so far, every candidate stair's entry-point badge (numbered, in its own distinct color matching the candidate's position in the explanation text's stair list), and the chosen (top-ranked) candidate's real corridor path (not a straight line) — all four highlighted with the same white halo/glow used elsewhere on the map. A green ring marks an accepted meeting between the two sides; a red dashed ring marks a rejected one. The final route, once the plan closes, is drawn in the same blue/amber split so you can see exactly how much of it each side contributed.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Short-term memory</strong> panel shows, for the current step, the stair sequence already committed on each side (tracking from the start, backtracking from the control) and which untried alternatives are still being held as fallbacks &mdash; this only appears while stepping through exploration, since nothing is left to remember once the plan closes.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Thinking effort</strong> panel summarizes mental steps, candidates evaluated, rejected meetings, plan depth, and how much longer the human route is than the optimal shortest path.</li>

                <li>Click <strong>Run Clustering</strong>. Every node and edge is drawn at its real position (not an abstract diagram), tinted by which same-floor cluster it belongs to. A translucent rounded "blob" is drawn behind each cluster's nodes so the floor region reads as one area.</li>
                <li>Stair edges (the seams between clusters) are drawn as neutral dashed lines regardless of which clusters they connect, distinct from same-floor corridors. One-way edges of either kind show a small direction chevron.</li>
                <li>The panel lists every cluster with its color swatch.</li>
